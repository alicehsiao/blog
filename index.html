      <h1>Exploring All the Places</h1>
      <h3>January 13, 2018</h3>
      <p>Location: Seattle, WA</p>
      <p>I visited and ran around Greenlake for the first time today. We did the beautiful 2.8 mile loop.</p>

      <h3>January 20, 2018</h3>
      <p>Location: Bay Area, CA</p>
      <p>I will be heading down to the Bay Area to celebrate the birthdays of two of my friends. We will be going on a San Francisco scavenger hunt, and then capping the night off at a bar with old school games.</p>

      <p>
        I just landed a job teaching high school math and science at an independent school in Seattle. I have recently been fascinated with all things concerning web development in my quest to create a personal website/blog. In addition, I have also come to enjoy traveling to other countries, visiting National Parks, and experiencing new things. I want to use this website to document all of my "firsts".
